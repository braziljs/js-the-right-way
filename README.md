## Note
For now we'll be using plain html for editing the guide, but soon it will be migrated to DocPad.

## Where

<http://www.jstherightway.org>

## Why?

Today we have a bunch of websites running JavaScript. I think we need a place to put all the best practices and references together so we can share this (good) information and help to keep the web more organized.

## Who

My name is [William Oliveira](http://github.com/gnuwilliam). I'm contributor of many open source projects, and also a Freelance Developer.
