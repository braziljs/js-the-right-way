# JS Code Style!

As every language, JavaScript has many code style guides. Maybe the most used and recommended is the [Google Code Style Guide for JavaScript][1], but we recommend you to read the [Idiomatic.js][2].

Nowadays the best tool to linting your JS code is the [JSHint][3]. We recommend you whanever possible to verify you code style with a Lint tool.
